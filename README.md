# My Beginner Website
Welcome to my beginner website project! This website was created as part of my journey into web development. It's a simple yet functional site built using only HTML and CSS.

## Features:
### Basic Structure: 
The website consists of multiple HTML pages linked together to create a cohesive browsing experience.
### CSS Styling: 
I've used CSS to style the elements of the website, including fonts, colors, layout, and more.
### Responsive Design: 
While I'm still learning, I've attempted to make the website responsive, ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.
###Content: 
The website contains information about myself, my interests, and perhaps a bit about my journey into web development.
## Usage:

### Open in Browser: 
Open any HTML file in your preferred web browser to view the website. You can start with index.html to navigate through the main page.

### Explore: 
Feel free to explore the website, click through links, and interact with different elements.

### Learn: 
As a beginner, I've documented my process within the code comments. Feel free to read through and learn along with me!

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas for enhancing the website, or if you spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
